# ðŸ“· Small Image Classification using CNN with CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project demonstrates image classification using the **CIFAR-10** dataset in TensorFlow. The objective is to compare the performance of a simple **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** with a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and understand why CNNs are more effective for image classification tasks.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- We use the **CIFAR-10** dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.
- First, we train a basic **ANN** model and evaluate its performance.
- Then, we implement a **CNN** model to highlight the significant improvement in accuracy.
- This comparison helps understand the importance of spatial feature extraction using convolutional layers in image classification tasks.
